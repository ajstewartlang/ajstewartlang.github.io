"<i>(visualisations)</i> should be autogenerated as part of the data analysis pipeline
(which should also be automated), and they should come out of the pipeline ready to
be sent to the printer...

...the moment you manually edit a figure, your final figure becomes irreproducible. A third
party cannot generate the exact same figure you did.

Interactive plot programs are a bad idea.  They inherently force you to manually prepare
your figures...be aware that Excel is an interactive plot program...and is not
recommended for figure preparation (or data analysis)."

# Using R Markdown Templates

.pull-left[
A number of R Markdown templates are available that allow you to write entire papers and talks (like this one) in R Markdown.
<br><br> 
The Papaja template (https://github.com/crsh) by Frederik Aust allows you to write APA formatted outputs and render in HTML, Word, and PDF format.

This talk was written in R Markdown using the Xaringan Presentation Ninja package (https://github.com/yihui/xaringan)
by Yihui Xie at RStudio. 
<br><br>
When I 'knit' my Markdown file, all the data visualisations, Twitter scraping etc. occurs on the fly
as my slides are rendered.
