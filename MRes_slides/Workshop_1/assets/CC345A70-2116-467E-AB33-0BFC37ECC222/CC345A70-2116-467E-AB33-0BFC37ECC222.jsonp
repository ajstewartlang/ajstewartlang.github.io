Pairwise comparisons conducted with the emmeans package (Lenth, 2018) were used to investigate the significant interaction for the reading time measure. Below we report regression coefficients (b), standard errors, and t-values. Restricted maximum likelihood estimation was used for the reporting of linear mixed model parameters. Deviation coding was used for each of the two experimental factors (Barr et al., 2013). Absolute values of the t-value greater than or equal to 1.96 indicate an effect that is significant at approximately the .05 alpha level. For pairwise comparisons we report the t- values and p-values. Degrees of freedom are approximated using the Satterthwaite method.
