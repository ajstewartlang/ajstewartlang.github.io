You’re interested in understanding how the number of points that a team scores is predicted by the amount of money invested in the team. As well as being in charge of F1, you also have a secret interest in statistical analysis. In “dataset1” you will find (for each of the 20 drivers) the amount of money invested in their particular car (in £100,000s) plus the total number of points they were awarded over the season. Work out the simple linear regression equation that captures the relationship between investment (as our predictor) and points awarded (as our outcome).
